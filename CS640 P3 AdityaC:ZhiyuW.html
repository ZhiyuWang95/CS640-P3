<h2> Problem Definition </h2>
<p>
Give a concise description of current problem.  What
needs to be solved?  Why is the result useful?  Do you make any assumptions?
What are the anticipated difficulties?<br />
<Ans1>
According to the description of the programming assignment, we need to finish the following assignments.<br />
1. Design a static evaluator,<br />
2. Select an adversarial search algorithm from the ones you have studied in class (e.g., minimax search, alpha-beta search, a heuristic pruning method),<br />
3. Implement this algorithm and apply it to the Atropos game,<br />
4. Clearly comment your code so that key algorithmic ideas are clear and parameters (e.g., lookahead depth of search) are easy to find and modify,<br />
5. Package your code so that the executable can participate in an automatic tournament.
</Ans1>

<h2> Method and Implementation </h2>
<p>Give a concise description of the implemented method. For example, you might
  describe the motivation of your idea, the algorithmic steps of your methods, or
  the mathematical formulation of your method.
<Ans1>
  Basically, for our player module, the inputs would be Board and LastPlay.<br />
  Input:<br />
  Board is in this format, [13][302][1003][30002][100003][3000002][121212]<br />
  LastPlay is like, LastPlay:(1,3,1,3).<br />
  There are 4 steps in our solution:<br />
  1. Find the available nodes around the LastPlay.<br />
  2. Generate all the possible moves and make a evaluation to each move.<br />
  3. Do minimax pruning to the evaluation tree.<br />
  4. Return the best next move.
</Ans1>
</p>

<p>
Briefly outline the functions you created in your code to carry out the
algorithmic steps you described earlier.
</p>
<Ans1>
  Our player module is written in python3, and we made 5 functions for our player module, they are<br />
  1. findAvailable()<br />
  Input is current board, it applys two for loop to scan the board, getting the locations for all the nodes with value 0.<br />
  Outputs for this function is a list of locations, like [(x1,y1),(x2,y2)...].<br />
  2. findNeighbors()<br />
  Inputs are current board, lastplay and a boolen requirement.
  it scans through all the neighbor nodes, and check if one is avaiable, if it is, it will be added into availble list, if not, added into the unavailable list.<br />
  The output depends on the requirement. If the requirement is True, return the available list, if the requirement if False, return the unavaiable list.<br />
  3. Loserfunction()<br />
  Loserfunction is used to detect if the current move will cause player to lose the game. So the input for this function is the current board and move list.<br />
  First it collects the color selection of current move, and scans through all neighbor of the move, collecting the colors of them. By detecting the amount of colors in the neighbors, it could judge if the move will cause a lose. Because if the amount of color reachs 3 after the move, which means all three colors are used in this area, a lose will happen.<br />
  The output is also a boolen, True means the move will cause lose.<br />
  4. evaluator()<br />
  Evaluator function is one of two core function for this player module. The meaning of this function is each move will be scored by several rules. We applied 4 rules for the evaluator function: <br />
  (1) Assign higher score when there are more uncolored neighbors for the move. <br />
  (2) Assign lower score when there are more differnent colored neighbors. <br />
  (3) Assign medium score to move when neighbots have same color as the move. <br />
  (4) Assign higher score when the move will cause few positions left after the move.<br />
  Besides that, if the move will cause a lose, the evaluator will return negative infinity if the level is a min level, and return positive infinity if the level is a max level. The output for this function is a list like (socre, move) pair. Move is the [c, x, y, z] list.<br />
  5. minimaxprune()<br />
  Minimaxprune function is another core function of the player module.

<h2>Experiments</h2>
<p>
Describe your experiments, including the number of tests that you
performed, and the relevant parameter values.  </p>
<p>
Define your evaluation
metrics, e.g., detection rates, accuracy, running time. </p>
<tr>
  <Ans1>
  For the experiment, we ran 10 games again zeekPlayer and 10 games against zookPlayer with the interface provided to us. The board size is 7, our player plays as the Script One, and the random player plays as the Script two. So in the result table, the "One" in the winner row means the Script One win the game, "Two" means Script Two win the game.
  </Ans1>

<hr>
<h2> Results</h2>
<p>
List your experimental results.  Provide examples of input images and output
images. If relevant, you may provide images showing any intermediate steps.  If
your work involves videos, do not submit the videos but only links to them.
</p>

<p>
<table>
<tr><td colspan=3><center><h3>Results</h3></center></td></tr>
<tr>
  <Ans1>
    For these 2 tournaments, in the 10 games play against zookPlayer, our player won 9 games out of 10. However when play against zeekPlayer, we just won 6 games out of 10. The details about the games, such as final boards, Lastplay and the step numbers could be checked in the links below "Games records against zookPlayer" and "Games records against zeekPlayer".

<h2> Discussion </h2>

<p> 
Discuss your method and results:
<ul>
<li>What are the strengths and weaknesses of your method? </li>
<li>Do your results show that your method is generally successful or
     are there limitations? Describe what you expected to find in your
     experiments, and how that differed or was confirmed by your
     results. </li>
<li>Potential future work. How could your method be improved?   What
would you try (if you had more time) to overcome the
failures/limitations of your work?</li> 
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Based on your discussion, what are your conclusions?  What is your
main message?
</p>
